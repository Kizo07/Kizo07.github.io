Welcome to my website, where I share my journey as a graduate student at the [UCLA Anderson School of Management](https://anderson.ucla.edu/), pursuing a Master's in Financial Engineering. Prior to this, I completed my bachelor’s in Civil Engineering at [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/).

Here, you'll find insights into my work experience, academic achievements, and the various projects I've undertaken. With over 3.5 years of experience as a Senior Quantitative Research Analyst with the QES team at [Wolfe Research](https://wolferesearch.com/), With over 3.5 years of experience as a Senior Quantitative Research Analyst at Wolfe Research, I've developed expertise in risk-neutralized alpha-generating strategies, particularly focusing on intangible assets, loss-making companies, Earninings Call Transcripts, and more.

As part of my current coursework at UCLA Anderson, I am deepening my expertise in finance and quantitative methods through classes such as Stochastic Calculus, Financial Accounting, Econometrics, and Investments. These courses are providing me with a robust foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of financial engineering. Additionally, I am participating in hands-on workshops that focus on Python, R, and advanced financial mathematics, equipping me with the latest tools and techniques essential for tackling complex financial problems. This comprehensive training is enhancing my skills for a career in quantitative research and risk management.

I am currently looking to apply my skills to internships with leading financial institutions, aiming to make an impact with innovative quantitative research, risk management, and portfolio optimization.

Thank you for visiting — I look forward to sharing my work with you! For more information, here's the link to my [Resume](https://kizorose.github.io/Resume.pdf)
